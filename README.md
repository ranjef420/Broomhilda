### File Naming Policy
Manuals follow the pattern:
Hilde_R1150RT_<ManualType>.pdf

This unified prefix combines the project identifier (“Hilde”) with the OEM model code (“R1150RT”)
to ensure personal identity, OEM traceability, and consistent assistant indexing across platforms.
All manuals are immutable and mirrored across assistant knowledge bases for redundancy.
