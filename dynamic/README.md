# DYNAMIC DIRECTORY – BROOMHILDA PROJECT

This directory houses **active and evolving project files** created or refined by the AI assistants.
All documents herein represent Tier 2–3 project-defined or working materials.

---

## PURPOSE
The `/dynamic/` directory serves as the workspace for:
- Service checklists (`djangogpt_*`)
- Diagnostic schemas and flowcharts (`kingschultz_*`)
- Wiring annotations and data crosswalks (`copilot_*`)
- Procedural drafts, maintenance logs, and temporary analyses

---

## RULES
1. **Authority Level:** Tier 2–3 — editable and evolving.
2. **Sync Policy:**  
   - Files marked `Pending Git Sync` must be reviewed and committed to the repo.  
   - Immutable references (manuals) are never stored here.
3. **Naming Convention:**  
assistantname_descriptor_YYYY-MM-DD.ext
4. **Backup & Version Control:**  
- Only finalized files are committed.  
- Assistants may generate new versions with date-stamped filenames.

---

## EXAMPLES
- `djangogpt_service-checklist_2025-10-15.md`
- `kingschultz_diagnostics-schema_2025-10-15.yaml`

## NOTES
- DjangoGPT maintains overall structure and style consistency.
- KingSchultz validates technical accuracy.
- Copilot performs linting, formatting, and repo-level integration checks.
